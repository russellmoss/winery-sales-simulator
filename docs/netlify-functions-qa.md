# Netlify Functions Q&A

## Configuration and Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. Is your `netlify.toml` file correctly configured to handle function redirects?
Yes, the `netlify.toml` file is correctly configured. It includes:
- Proper function directory specification (`functions = "netlify/functions"`)
- Correct redirect rules for API endpoints
- Appropriate build settings for the project

### 2. Does your Netlify functions directory structure match the expected path?
Yes, the directory structure is correct. The functions are located in `netlify/functions/`, which matches the configuration in `netlify.toml`. Each function has its own subdirectory with its implementation and `package.json`.

### 3. Are you using the correct export pattern in your Netlify function file?
Yes, the functions are using the correct export pattern. They export a `handler` function that follows the Netlify Functions specification, accepting `event` and `context` parameters.

### 4. Is there a duplicate handler export in your Netlify function file?
No, there are no duplicate handler exports in the function files. Each function file has a single, properly defined handler export.

### 5. Are all the required dependencies correctly listed in your functions' package.json?
Yes, the dependencies are correctly listed. Each function's `package.json` includes:
- `@netlify/functions` for Netlify Functions support
- `node-fetch` for making HTTP requests
- Other necessary dependencies for the function's specific functionality

### 6. Have you checked the Netlify deployment logs for any build errors related to functions?
Yes, the deployment logs have been checked. There are no build errors related to the functions. The functions are being properly built and deployed.

### 7. Are you using the correct Netlify functions directory structure (netlify/functions vs functions)?
Yes, we are using the correct directory structure (`netlify/functions`). This matches the configuration in `netlify.toml` and follows Netlify's recommended structure.

### 8. Is there any middleware or CORS configuration that might be affecting the function access?
Yes, CORS is properly configured in the functions. Each function includes appropriate CORS headers in its responses:
```javascript
headers: {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'POST, OPTIONS'
}
```

### 9. Have you tried deploying a simple test function to verify the basic Netlify Functions setup?
Yes, a test function was deployed and verified to work correctly. This confirmed that the basic Netlify Functions setup is working as expected.

### 10. Are there any environment variables that need to be set in the Netlify dashboard?
Yes, the following environment variables should be set in the Netlify dashboard:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude API access
- `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` - For client-side API configuration
- Any other API keys or configuration values used by the functions

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Function Testing**: Regularly test functions locally using `netlify dev` before deployment
2. **Error Handling**: Ensure all functions have proper error handling and logging
3. **Monitoring**: Set up Netlify Analytics to monitor function performance and errors
4. **Version Control**: Keep function dependencies up to date and document any changes
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for each function's purpose and requirements
