  "narrative": "Jim and Mina from Washington DC come to Milea Estate Vineyard in Staatsburg, NY. They are really excited to be there. Their friends Mike and Ann have a winery in Bhutan. The grapes there are really great because they have a world class viticulturist and they heard that the same viticulturist runs Milea. Jim and Mina love Bhutan wine, but they have a distaste for Mike. They really like Ann. They are fun and funny and really love buying local wine. They are visiting Milea because they know of the General Manager. Their wine knowledge is intermediate and their budget is intermediate."
